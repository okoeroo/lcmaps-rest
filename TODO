To do list:
===========

FQAN support:
-------------
Being able to push FQANs over the REST interface. 


Double identity aka pilot job support:
--------------------------------------
SSL + REST information, meaning double identity


Rate limiter/pool mapping commiter:
-----------------------------------
Being able to rate limit mapping requests.
Possibly by allowing endless mappings to occure, but being able to commit them
or release them on PAM failure, for example.


Sign response with private key of the LCMAPS-REST service
---------------------------------------------------------
Allows for caching of the data, while being able to verify that it originated
from it in the first place. This safes you the entire LCMAPS step on a cache
hit.
